      <description>Throughout the school year, and especially while working as a statistical consultant, people would often ask me about how I learned to program in R. Since my answer of: “trial and error, practice, and classes” was insufficient for just about everyone, I wanted to compile a few resources here.
Just as a quick note, just about any programming experience will help you in R as well. Concepts in languages such as Python and Java will directly transfer over to R.</description>

      <description>66 days.
In a 2009 study by Lally et al. (2009), researchers found that their study of 96 individuals took on average 66 days to truly form a habit. While the amount of time varied from 18 to 254 days, 66 gives us a definitive number to work towards.
Change has, and always will be difficult. It takes dedication, intention, and a commitment to breaking old habits, even when it becomes painful.</description>
