      <description>66 days.
In a 2009 study by Lally et al.Â (2009), researchers found that their study of 96 individuals took on average 66 days to truly form a habit. While the amount of time varied from 18 to 254 days, 66 gives us a definitive number to work towards.
Change has, and always will be difficult. It takes dedication, intention, and a commitment to breaking old habits, even when it becomes painful.</description>
