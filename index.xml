      <description>In this post, I will explain how I created this website. This will include what resources I used, how I combined blogdown in R with GitHub Pages, and the various changes required for it to function correctly.
I will assume the user has already created a github.io page and linked GitHub and RStudio. I will assume familiarity with GitHub and R in general.
If the two assumptions are met, and the user does not spend too long choosing themes, the basic setup should not take more than 20 minutes.</description>

      <description>About Me Welcome, my name is David Chen. Put simply, I love sharing statistics and analytics with those around me. Currently I work as a Research Assistant within the Statistics Department, and (during the academic year) as a research consultant for the Data Learning Center within the University Libraries. I will be graduating with my master&amp;rsquo;s in applied statistics and my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s in statistics (computer science option) in May 2021.</description>
