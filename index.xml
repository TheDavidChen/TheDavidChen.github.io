      <description>Throughout the school year, and especially while working as a statistical consultant, people would often ask me about how I learned to program in R. Since my answer of: “trial and error, practice, and classes” was insufficient for just about everyone, I wanted to compile a few resources here.
Just as a quick note, just about any programming experience will help you in R as well. Concepts in languages such as Python and Java will directly transfer over to R.</description>

      <title>Day 0 - 66 Days To Build A Habit</title>

      <description>66 days.
In a 2009 study by Lally et al. (2009), researchers found that their study of 96 individuals took on average 66 days to truly form a habit. While the amount of time varied from 18 to 254 days, 66 gives us a definitive number to work towards.
Change has, and always will be difficult. It takes dedication, intention, and a commitment to breaking old habits, even when it becomes painful.</description>

      <description>Google AnalyticsAs someone who adores stats, we of course need to set up stats for the website! Google analytics provides a free service that provides fairly detailed metrics on website performance. These statistics include:
Number of usersHow long users stay on the websiteHow users are acquiredUser retentionGeographical location of usersGeneral user behaviorSetup was extremely simple. After a quick registration where you provide the website URL and select privacy options, the google analytics account is created.</description>

      <description>In this post, I will explain how I created this website. This will include what resources I used, how I combined blogdown in R with GitHub Pages, and the various changes required for it to function correctly.
I will assume the user has already created a github.io page and linked GitHub and RStudio. I will assume familiarity with GitHub and R in general.
If the two assumptions are met, and the user does not spend too long choosing themes, the basic setup should not take more than 20 minutes.</description>
