      <description>.standard {background-color: lightgray;font-weight: bold;color:black}Three years ago I taught myself R to help process and visualize data for my research lab. Since then, I have easily spent hundreds, if not a thousand plus hours processing, modeling, visualizing, analyzing, tutoring, and struggling with the language. Even though I took multiple classes in Python, I never had the opportunity to explore matplotlib and pandas, the two packages that seem unanimous with Python for data analysis.</description>

      <title>R - Overview of v1.0.0 of dtplyr and dplyr</title>

      <description>In this post, we discuss v1.0.0 of the dtplyr package and some changes made in the v1.0.0 update of dplyr. This post essentially summarizes these two posts:
dtplyr 1.0.0 - Hadley Wickhamdplyr 1.0.0 - Hadley WickhamAs these are two short, well-written posts, I highly recommend simply reading those two posts. If not, hopefully this post will inspire you to read them afterwards.
DtplyrSummaryIf you prefer dplyr syntax over data.</description>

      <title>R/Rstudio - Why Use Projects?</title>

      <description>The use of projects (.Rproj files) is fundamental to organized coding and project management, and should be used essentially 100% of the time while using RStudio. Thus in this post, we will discuss why you should use projects, how to create them, and some organization standards. We will also list a few additional resources for you to learn more about the subject at the very end.
Why Use It?In my opinion, there are four fundamental reasons why you should use projects:</description>

      <description>Work in progress!
Whenever we need to include functional R code, whether it’s to check the output or just see how it was written, we include code chunks. Yet, currently on this website, it is extremely difficult to differentiate from the normal text.
Prior to this post, code chunks would appear like the following:

There are three primary issues here.</description>

      <description>Friendly reminder that I am a student, and not a professional in the field. Please review the resources below before implementing the model. If there are any errors, please leave a comment/contact me and I will get it resolved immediately.
IntroductionTimes series. Simply put, when data is collected repeatedly over time, it often becomes a time series problem. It is extremely commonly used in academia and in industry, as this analysis can forecast future values, explain how the past influences the future, and highlight changes over time.</description>

IntroductionA/B testing. If you’re a student like me, you probably have never heard of it before in your statistics classes before. It sounds fancy. It sounds complex.
It’s neither of those.</description>

IntroductionData often contains an inherent hierarchical nature, where some variables are nested within others.
A common example is student education. The data could be broken up into the following levels (example from (Woltman et al.</description>

      <title>Resources to Learn R</title>

      <description>Throughout the school year, and especially while working as a statistical consultant, people would often ask me about how I learned to program in R. Since my answer of: “trial and error, practice, and classes” was insufficient for just about everyone, I wanted to compile a few resources here.
Just as a quick note, just about any programming experience will help you in R as well. Concepts in languages such as Python and Java will directly transfer over to R.</description>

      <title>Day 0 - 66 Days To Build A Habit</title>

      <description>66 days.
In a 2009 study by Lally et al. (2009), researchers found that their study of 96 individuals took on average 66 days to truly form a habit. While the amount of time varied from 18 to 254 days, 66 gives us a definitive number to work towards.
Change has, and always will be difficult. It takes dedication, intention, and a commitment to breaking old habits, even when it becomes painful.</description>

      <description>Google AnalyticsAs someone who adores stats, we of course need to set up stats for the website! Google analytics provides a free service that provides fairly detailed metrics on website performance. These statistics include:
Number of usersHow long users stay on the websiteHow users are acquiredUser retentionGeographical location of usersGeneral user behaviorSetup was extremely simple. After a quick registration where you provide the website URL and select privacy options, the google analytics account is created.</description>

      <description>In this post, I will explain how I created this website. This will include what resources I used, how I combined blogdown in R with GitHub Pages, and the various changes required for it to function correctly.
I will assume the user has already created a github.io page and linked GitHub and RStudio. I will assume familiarity with GitHub and R in general.
If the two assumptions are met, and the user does not spend too long choosing themes, the basic setup should not take more than 20 minutes.</description>
